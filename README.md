## Overview
This project aims to develop a Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesizer for the Hindi language, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques for corpus generation and audio synthesis. The goal is to create a system that can convert written Hindi text into natural-sounding speech.

## Features
- **Corpus Generation**: Automated scripts to generate a rich linguistic corpus suitable for training TTS models.
- **Audio Synthesis**: Integration of state-of-the-art neural network models to produce clear and natural Hindi speech.
- **Customizable Voices**: Ability to adjust voice characteristics such as pitch, speed, and tone.
- **Support for SSML**: Implementation of Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) for fine-grained control over speech output.
