Hindi TTS Speech Synthesizer
Overview
Welcome to our Hindi TTS Speech Synthesizer project! Our mission is to convert written Hindi text into spoken words, sounding as natural and clear as possible. We’re harnessing the power of machine learning to make it happen


# l-hindi-text-to-speech


## Overview
This project aims to develop a Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesizer for the Hindi language, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques for corpus generation and audio synthesis. The goal is to create a system that can convert written Hindi text into natural-sounding speech.

## Features
- **Corpus Generation**: Automated scripts to generate a rich linguistic corpus suitable for training TTS models.
- **Audio Synthesis**: Integration of state-of-the-art neural network models to produce clear and natural Hindi speech.
- **Customizable Voices**: Ability to adjust voice characteristics such as pitch, speed, and tone.
- **Support for SSML**: Implementation of Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) for fine-grained control over speech output.
